CS50x Final project Fall 2020:

For this course's project I have decided to create a Google Chrome Extension that can be used by people from different range of age.

My Extension is called "Daily Dash" and it would do the following tasks:

- A simple fun tool to help you organize your daily plans by creating To Do list.
- It will provide up-to-date information from reliable resources about Covid-19 to help users be educated about the virus, it's outcomes,
  how they can protect themselves and what govenmental supports they can use that they might have not known before.
- There are also a total of twelve coloured themes with an option of custom background setup.
- Daily Dash would greet and compliment you each time you open it, in order to bring a little touch of humor and spread positivity to your daily browsing.
